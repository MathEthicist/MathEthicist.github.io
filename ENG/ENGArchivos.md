# Welcome to the Archives.

Here  you will find documents about my classes or other topics. The documents insteresting to my students are indexed by course and chapters. I hope I won't be lazy enough and will update this when I am supposed to.

First I must mention the [Notes of Marea Verde](http://www.apuntesmareaverde.org.es) which are text books in digital format completely free. They are as bad as the ones form the other editorials, but free, so better recommend these ones as they are more accesible.

Another essential link, in particular for the students of 2nd of Bachillerato, is the website [Musat](http://musat.net), where you can find hundreds of exercises, solved, taken right from the EVAU. A titanic job made altruistically by a great maths teacher.

## Classes at the High School "".

## Links to Other Interesting Websites.
- [Category Theory Applied to Music.](https://alpof.wordpress.com) 
- [Linear Algebra with graphics and diagrams, furthermore it has a recipe for making crema di mascarpone.](https://graphicallinearalgebra.net)
- [Libgen: very legal online library for downloading science.](http://93.174.95.27)
- [Scihub: superlegar system of getting scientific papers or books.](https://sci-hub.st) If it is not working, look [here for updated links.](https://sci-hub.now.sh)
- [List of updated repositories of libgen and scihub](https://vertsluisants.fr/index.php?article4/where-scihub-libgen-server-down). If not, another decent strategy would be to check the wikipedia of those sites because it used to have the latest functional links. Nevertheless, some internet companies of Sapin and UK block these pages so another good idea may be use a VPN.
