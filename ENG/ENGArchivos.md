# Welcome to the Archives.

Here  you will find documents about my classes or other topics. The documents insteresting to my students are indexed by course and chapters. I hope I won't be lazy enough and will update this when I am supposed to.

First I must mention the [Notes of Marea Verde](http://www.apuntesmareaverde.org.es) which are text books in digital format completely free. They are as bad as the ones form the other editorials, but free, so better recommend these ones as they are more accesible.

Another essential link, in particular for the students of 2nd of Bachillerato, is the website [Musat](http://musat.net), where you can find hundreds of exercises, solved, taken right from the EVAU. A titanic job made altruistically by a great maths teacher.
