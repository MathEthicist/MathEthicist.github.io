Well, related to my interests I like a lot the mathematical investigation. In spite of not having been able to do a Ph.D, mostly because economical reasons, I love maths and what you could call advanced maths: as algebraic geometry, category theory and algebraic topology. The study of algebra and, in particular, the algebraic structures, has always looked the most beatiful to me because of the sense of abstraction of the structure. Algebraic structures allow us to understand how a set of objects can be related through some operations (natural numbers and the sum, for example). This structures, that could be groups, rings or modules, are related intrinsically too in a lot of fancy contexts. In geometry is highly interesting. Depending on the geometry we are interested we can study algebraic geometry (zeros of polynomials), algebraic topology (topological spaces) and differential geometry (this last is not very funny to me but it is true that, historically, is the most illuminating and simple way to have a first look into the algebra inside the geometry of manifolds). In general, if you know a bit, the topics I most like about these areas are the theory os schemes of Grothendieck and the theories of homology, cohomology and homotopy. In category theory, which now I am starting to study, I am interested in topoi, their relation with logics and the new fundations of mathematics that can be made with them.

Because of this, I have in mind to make [Archives](ENGArchivos.html) that could be helpful to study new mathematical notions which are useful and devoted to mathematical and logical interests, not to an old-fashioned curriculum of 1850. So I will try to include documents about groups, rings and even categories thought for some secondary and preuniversity courses. Furthemore, some revisions of standar contents in the curriculum will be included, such as ecuations or probability.

Interests or hobbies not related to maths are playing guitar, horticulture (I have a tiny orchard but I dream with an expansion) and understanding references of the new popculture, cool, cool cool cool.
