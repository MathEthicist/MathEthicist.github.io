## Home

My name is Daniel and this website has only a didactic and informative purpose, in particular, about the maths classes I teach at the high school, my professional profile and my interests related to math. 

In the top links you can access all the information you are looking for. 

While I try to learn HTML, and that is far from now, this was the easiest option for creating a website. 
My methods are old but effective, complaints [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GicJVYQvcg&list=LLecsc4UOOJfb3kJ5_0Mxe2A&index=39&t=0s).
